# Problem Solving and Programming Assessment 1

---

## Brief

There are two parts to this assignment:

### Part I: Petals Around the Rose

You are required to write a Python program that allows a user to play a game called Petals Around the Rose. The
program allows the user to repeatedly guess the answer to the puzzle until the user chooses to stop guessing/playing.
Once the user chooses to stop guessing, the program will report the userâ€™s and game play statistics to the screen.
You may like to play a web version of the game: http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-j.htm.

### Part II: Number converter

You are required to write a Python program that performs decimal to binary conversion (and vice versa) on numbers
entered by the user. You are only required to deal with whole numbers. If you are interested, you may like to read the
following on binary numbers: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number.
